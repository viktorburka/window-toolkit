Window Toolkit is a C++ widgets toolkit. Currently it supports X11 backend as a rendering API via Xlib C library which provides asyncronous API to render raster graphics.

I have Wayland backend in the works and right now its just proof of concept that renders some geometry on the screen. You can find that code in playground repository (https://github.com/viktorburka/playground/tree/master/wt-wayland-backend). Although not very reach graphics displayed, it does all the setup and wiring necessary to get started.

Comparing to X11, Wayland is a very cutting edge protocol that is based on rendering directly into the shared memory provided by the Wayland display server (currently I tested it on Weston) so that pixeles being rendered end up in the display server buffers right away. It is different from X11 where the user doesn't have direct access to the server buffers and the rendering happens via sending network commands that due to asyncronous nature and for optimization purposes don't get sent right away by default but accumulate in a package before they are transferred to the X11 display server by Xlib. This behaviour can be changed by forcing those commands to be sent right away but still it is a much slower method than rendering directly into the buffer. At the time I started writing Window Toolkit, Wayland was not very stable as well as there was a lack of documentation and examples on how it works. X11 from another side has proven to be reliable by decades its been in production as well has much better documentation available.

There is also another well known client library that implements X11 protocol called xcb that has syncronous nature comparing to Xlib that is asyncronous. I have plans to get it working as well some time later.
